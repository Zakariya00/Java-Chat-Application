1. display failed to connect to server in connect window if server is not running.
2. multiple clients - thread

3. display messages to all clients directly when one client writes a message.
-right now, each client only reads the messages array when it sends its own message. we want all clients to read the message array.

4. user x has disconnected/left the chat
